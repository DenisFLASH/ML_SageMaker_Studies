    "# Plagiarism Detection, Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will be tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines an answer text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided, source text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task will be to create some features that can then be used to train a classification model. This task will be broken down into a few discrete steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clean and pre-process the data.\n",
    "* Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.\n",
    "* Select \"good\" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.\n",
    "* Create train/test `.csv` files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the _next_ notebook, Notebook 3, you'll use the features and `.csv` files you create in _this_ notebook to train a binary classification model in a SageMaker notebook instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be defining a few different similarity features, as outlined in [this paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf), which should help you build a robust plagiarism detector!\n",

At it's heart, this task is a comparison text; one that looks at a given answer and a source text, compares them and predicts whether an answer has plagiarized from the source. To effectively do this comparison, and train a classifier we'll need to do a few more things: pre-process all of our text data and prepare the text files (in this case, the 95 answer files and 5 original source files) to be easily compared, and split our data into a `train` and `test` set that can be used to train a classifier and evaluate it, respectively. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. A `Text` column; this holds all the lowercase text for a `File`, with extraneous punctuation removed.\n",
    "2. A `Datatype` column; this is a string value `train`, `test`, or `orig` that labels a data point as part of our train or test set\n",

    "# Similarity Features \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways we might go about detecting plagiarism, is by computing **similarity features** that measure how similar a given answer text is as compared to the original wikipedia source text (for a specific task, a-e). The similarity features you will use are informed by [this paper on plagiarism detection](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf). \n",
    "> In this paper, researchers created features called **containment** and **longest common subsequence**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these features as input, you will train a model to distinguish between plagiarized and not-plagiarized text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk a bit more about the features we want to include in a plagiarism detection model and how to calculate such features. In the following explanations, I'll refer to a submitted text file as a **Student Answer Text (A)** and the original, wikipedia source file (that we want to compare that answer to) as the **Wikipedia Source Text (S)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Containment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task will be to create **containment features**. To understand containment, let's first revisit a definition of [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram). An *n-gram* is a sequential word grouping. For example, in a line like \"bayes rule gives us a way to combine prior knowledge with new information,\" a 1-gram is just one word, like \"bayes.\" A 2-gram might be \"bayes rule\" and a 3-gram might be \"combine prior knowledge.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> Containment is defined as the **intersection** of the n-gram word count of the Wikipedia Source Text (S) with the n-gram word count of the Student  Answer Text (S) *divided* by the n-gram word count of the Student Answer Text.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A}) \\cap count(\\text{ngram}_{S})}}{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A})}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the two texts have no n-grams in common, the containment will be 0, but if _all_ their n-grams intersect then the containment will be 1. Intuitively, you can see how having longer n-gram's in common, might be an indication of cut-and-paste plagiarism. In this project, it will be up to you to decide on the appropriate `n` or several `n`'s to use in your final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXERCISE: Create containment features\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the `complete_df` that you've created, you should have all the information you need to compare any Student  Answer Text (A) with its appropriate Wikipedia Source Text (S). An answer for task A should be compared to the source text for task A, just as answers to tasks B, C, D, and E should be compared to the corresponding original source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll complete the function, `calculate_containment` which calculates containment based upon the following parameters:\n",
    "* A given DataFrame, `df` (which is assumed to be the `complete_df` from above)\n",
    "* An `answer_filename`, such as 'g0pB_taskd.txt' \n",
    "* An n-gram length, `n`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Containment calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps to complete this function are as follows:\n",
    "1. From *all* of the text files in a given `df`, create an array of n-gram counts; it is suggested that you use a [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) for this purpose.\n",
    "2. Get the processed answer and source texts for the given `answer_filename`.\n",
    "3. Calculate the containment between an answer and source text according to the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >$$ \\frac{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A}) \\cap count(\\text{ngram}_{S})}}{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A})}} $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Return that containment value.\n",
    "\n",

    "If you read through the scenario above, you can see that this algorithm depends on looking at two texts and comparing them word by word. You can solve this problem in multiple ways. First, it may be useful to `.split()` each text into lists of comma separated words to compare. Then, you can iterate through each word in the texts and compare them, adding to your value for LCS as you go. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method I recommend for implementing an efficient LCS algorithm is: using a matrix and dynamic programming. **Dynamic programming** is all about breaking a larger problem into a smaller set of subproblems, and building up a complete result without having to repeat any subproblems. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach assumes that you can split up a large LCS task into a combination of smaller LCS tasks. Let's look at a simple example that compares letters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A = \"ABCD\"\n",
    "* S = \"BD\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see right away that the longest subsequence of _letters_ here is 2 (B and D are in sequence in both strings). And we can calculate this by looking at relationships between each letter in the two strings, A and S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I have a matrix with the letters of A on top and the letters of S on the left side:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_1.png' width=40% />\n",

    "This starts out as a matrix that has as many columns and rows as letters in the strings S and O **+1** additional row and column, filled with zeros on the top and left sides. So, in this case, instead of a 2x4 matrix it is a 3x5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can fill this matrix up by breaking it into smaller LCS problems. For example, let's first look at the shortest substrings: the starting letter of A and S. We'll first ask, what is the Longest Common Subsequence between these two letters \"A\" and \"B\"? \n",

    "\n",
    "One thing to notice here is that, you can efficiently fill up this matrix one cell at a time. Each grid cell only depends on the values in the grid cells that are directly on top and to the left of it, or on the diagonal/top-left. The rules are as follows:\n",
    "* Start with a matrix that has one extra row and column of zeros.\n",
    "* As you traverse your string:\n",
    "    * If there is a match, fill that grid cell with the value to the top-left of that cell *plus* one. So, in our case, when we found a matching B-B, we added +1 to the value in the top-left of the matching cell, 0.\n",
    "    * If there is not a match, take the *maximum* value from either directly to the left or the top cell, and carry that value over to the non-match cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_rules.png' width=50% />\n",
    "\n",
    "After completely filling the matrix, **the bottom-right cell will hold the non-normalized LCS value**.\n",

    "All of our features try to measure the similarity between two texts. Since our features are designed to measure similarity, it is expected that these features will be highly-correlated. Many classification models, for example a Naive Bayes classifier, rely on the assumption that features are *not* highly correlated; highly-correlated features may over-inflate the importance of a single feature. \n",
